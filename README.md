# Overview

With C++ being such a popular language, I thought it important to try
to become more proficient in the language in addition to strengthening my software engineering skills.

This software is a command line app that allows the user to choose a game or calculator from a menu and run through each program.
When the sub-program finishes execution, it returns to the menu to allow the user to select another option.

The goal of this project was to learn and expand upon my knowledge of C++. I had a basic level understanding of this language through university courses
and online tutorials, and so I wanted to put my skills to the test.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio as my IDE

This program is written in C++, and uses the standard set of libraries.

# Future Work

- Add additional programs to both games and calculators.
- Add more redundant code to the AllPrograms class from the other classes to be reused by them without writing it multiple times.
- Alter the menus to make them look more visually appealing.
